SpringLobbyStats
================
Perl application to monitor the [SpringRTS](http://springrts.com/) lobby and
compute various statistics concerning players, bots, battles, games and network
status. These statistics can then be stored in Round Robin databases and used
to produce various graphs.

Components
----------
* [CactiPatch](CactiPatch/cacti-0.8.8a+dfsg-5+deb7u2.patch): Patch for Cacti
  0.8.8a from Debian 7.2 (fix a bug in FTP export, add timespan dependant graph
  smoothing functionality, and bring minor cosmetic changes in exported pages)
* [StatClient](StatClient/statClient.pl): SpringRTS lobby statistics client,
  used to poll statistics generated by StatServ regularly.
* [StatServ](StatServ): SpringRTS lobby statistics service bot (it monitors the
  lobby and computes various statistics in real time)

StatServ is based on the templates provided by following project:
* [SpringLobbyBot](https://github.com/Yaribz/SpringLobbyBot)

Dependencies
------------
The SpringLobbyStats application depends on following projects:
* [SimpleLog](https://github.com/Yaribz/SimpleLog)
* [SpringLobbyInterface](https://github.com/Yaribz/SpringLobbyInterface)

Installation
------------
* Copy the dependencies listed above ([SimpleLog.pm](https://raw.github.com/Yaribz/SimpleLog/master/SimpleLog.pm)
  and [SpringLobbyInterface.pm](https://raw.github.com/Yaribz/SpringLobbyInterface/master/SpringLobbyInterface.pm))
  into the StatServ directory
* Edit the StatServ/etc/statServ.conf file to set following parameters:
  lobbyLogin (name of the lobby account used by StatServ), lobbyPassword
  (password of the lobby account used by StatServ), etcDir (directory
  containing StatServ config files), varDir (directory containing StatServ
  dynamic data), logDir (directory containing StatServ log files)
* Edit the StatClient/statClient.pl file and replace &lt;statDir&gt; by the
  varDir configured in previous step
* Replace &lt;ownerName&gt; by your actual Spring lobby account name (not the
  one of StatServ) in StatServ/etc/users.conf
* Go into StatServ directory and launch the statistic service bot using command
  "./statServ.pl etc/statServ.conf"
* Configure your favorite supervision system to poll Spring statistics
  regularly using the StatClient application (a polling interfal of 5 minutes
  can be used for example). If you are using Cacti, consider applying the patch
  provided in CactiPath directory.
